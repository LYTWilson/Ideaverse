Based on the [[Inbox/Darwinian Evolutionary Theory#^8cf4ce\|sexual selection theory]], Robert Trivers developed this theory.

The idea is that the sex that invests more effort and time will be more discriminating in selection (more picky).

> In other words, Trivers explained what Darwin had assiduously documented, but could not fully explain â€“ why in many species males court and females choose.

# How humans might relate to this theory
This explains why now humans are picky in both sexes, instead of our ancestors.

Both females and males commit time and effort into rearing their offspring, so both sexes are picky at mates. 

However, women tend to invest more in having children and raising children due to biological reasons. Therefore, females should be (and tend to be) a liitle more choosy than men.
