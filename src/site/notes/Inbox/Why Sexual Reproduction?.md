# Reason
Sexual reproduction **shuffles the genetic deck**, producing **variability** across species, which facilitates the evolution of adaptations. Thus, some argue that the process of evolution itself may have **evolved**.
# How this relates to the evolutionary theory?
- Survivability
	- variability in immune systems
		- resist parasites and pathogens
