> [!attention] Explanation
> To illustrate the concept of reciprocal determinism, Consider A student who believes they have the ability to succeed on an exam (self-efficacy) is more likely to put forth the necessary effort to study (behavior).
> 
> If they do not believe they can pass the exam, they are less likely to study. As a result, their beliefs about their abilities (self-efficacy) will be affirmed or disconfirmed by their actual performance on the exam (outcome).

Reciprocal determinism is the central concept of social cognitive theory and refers to the dynamic and reciprocal interaction of people — individuals with a set of learned experiences — the environment, external social context, and behavior — the response to stimuli to achieve goals.

Its main tenet is that people seek to develop a sense of agency and exert control over the important events in their lives.

This sense of agency and control is affected by factors such as self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goals, and self-evaluation (Bandura, 1989).

- Neurobiology of self-efficacy
	- role of frontal & prefrontal lobes
	- role of right & left hemispheres
		- the right hemisphere of the brain reacts to the dilemmas using its linguistic ability
		- then the abstract left hemisphere processes it
- Self-efficacy yields sense of control 
	- production of neuroendocrines and catecholemines
		- This suggests that when individuals have higher levels of self-efficacy, there is an increase in the production of catecholamines, and vice versa.
