# Motivation as a need
## Maslow 
By [[Inbox/Hierarchy of Needs\|Hierarchy of Needs]], lower-order needs should be fulfilled to promote motivation to higher-order needs.

*Manager shouldn’t say about values when the salary is too low.*

## ERG
In the Existence-Relatedness-Growth Theory (ERG), existence needs are derived from Maslow’s basic biological and safety needs, relatedness needs from social and ego needs, and growth needs from self-actualization needs.

## Self-monitoring
***High self-monitors*** tend to control images that they present to better fit with the social climate around them.

***Low self-monitors*** tend to be true to themselves and display more consistent behavior across various social contexts.

**Self Monitoring Scale** was shortened from 25 items to 18 items is used (Gangestad & Snyder, 1985). 

Self-monitoring was shown to have a positive relationship with job performance (Day, Schleicher, Unckless & Hiller, 2002).
# Motivation as cognition
## Goal orientations
- **Performance-prove goal orientation (PGO)**: One seeks to pursue and maintain positive judgement of their ability.
- **Performance-avoid goal orientation (AGO)**: One seeks to avoid negative judgement of their ability.
- **Learning goal orientation (LGO)**: One seeks to increase their ability or master new tasks.

***Mechanic structures*** are places where task differentiates a lot, highly formalized and centralized.

PGO and LGO is negatively associated.

***Organic Structures*** are places that are fluid and decentralized, no formally defined task.

PGO and LGO is positively associated.
