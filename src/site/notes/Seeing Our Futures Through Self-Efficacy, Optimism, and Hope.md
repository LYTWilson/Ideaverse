Three parts are included: self-efficacy, optimism, and hope.
# Self-efficacy
## What is self-efficacy?
Bandura defined self-efficacy as “people’s beliefs in their capabilities to produce desired effects by their own actions”

Maddux (2009a) has described self- efficacy as “what I believe I can do with my skills under certain conditions”.
## How is it measured?
- Outcome expectancies — Examine what I **neccessary** have to do to be a millionaire 
	- build a business
	- jackpot
- Efficacy expectancies — I analyze if I have the capability do the above neccessary actions
	- I found out that I don’t 
For Bandura, outcome expectancies are viewed as far less important than efficacy expectancies. 
## Where does it come from?
- Self-efficacy is learnt not genetically gained.
- begins in infancy and continues

Based on [[Social cognitive theory\|Social cognitive theory]], 
- People can symbolize their experiences to create models
- By, observing themselves, people will self-regulate their actions to the following life events
	- eg. I think I am not capable to get an A, but the environment (test result) tells me I can, I will regulate my behaviours to be an A student.
- [[Reciprocal Determinism\|Personalities as an result of reciprocal interactions]]
## What builds or diminishes self-efficacy?
1. Previous successes in similar situations 
2. Modeling on others in the same situations (observe people who have succeeded)
3. Imagining yourself behaving effectively
4. Arousal and emotion 
	- eg. You feel good when you score, and therfore believe that you are capable to score and be a good player, in other words, increased self-efficacy.
5. Undergoing verbal persuasion by powerful, trustworthy, expert, and attractive other people 
	- eg. Being proud of by someone you like or respect.

	- Career Self-Efficacy Scale
	- Occupational Questionnaire
	- Career Counseling Self-Efficacy Scale
	- Coping Self-Efficacy Scale
	- Cultural Self-Efficacy Scale
	- Memory Self-Efficacy Scale
- Dispositional (related to traits, or temperament)
	- includes these 2 factors
		- general self-efficacy
		- social self-efficacy
	- examples
		- Self-Efficacy Scale by Sheer
		- New General Self-Efficacy Scale by Chen 
## Impacts on different aspects
Higher self-efficacy predicts: (not that important)
- lower anxiety
- higher pain tolerance
- better academic performance
- more political participation
- effective dental practices
- continuation in smoking cessation
- adoption of diet & exercise regimes
- successful coping
- overcoming eating disorders & abuse - life satisfaction
- is an “enablement factor”
	- help people select and structure their life 
	- self-efficacy give them the ‘power’ to take control of live events?
- increased health-related behaviors
- decreased unhealthy behaviors - increased immune functioning - increased catecholemines
- increased pain endorphins

Five strategies might be used.
- Building successes, often through the use of goal setting and the incremental meeting of those goals 
- Using models to teach the person to overcome difficulties 
- Allowing the person to imagine himself or herself behaving effectively 
- Using verbal persuasion by a trustworthy psychotherapist 
- Teaching techniques for lowering arousal (e.g., meditation, mindfulness, biofeedback, hypnosis, relaxation) to increase the likelihood of more adaptive, self-efficacious thinking
